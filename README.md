<b>mcr HTML/CSS/JS Portfolio ⚛️</b>

---

👋 I present my portfolio built with HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

🔰 This is my first "real" project as a developer, see it more as a demonstration of skills rather than a real portfolio with real intentions of selling myself.

Do not hesitate to give me your feedback on any platform so I can improve! 🙏

🎨 I used Adobe Illustrator for the design parts.

💻 And HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript for the development.
